# ConsoleVendingMachineGame
A .NET Console application game about interacting with a Vending Machine. The goal of the game is to eat and drink enough to raise your thirst and hunger above a certain threshold.
The user can choose between different menus, with each choice increasing their move count. Each move decreases their thirst and hunger, and so moves must be chosen carefully.

## Features

- There are many different menus to interact with such as Main Menu, Purchase Menu, Inventory Menu, EarnMoney Menu, ShakeVendingMachine Menu, etc.
- The user can earn money or items by using the EarnMoney or ShakeVendingMachine menus which use random numbers to represent chance.
- Each vending machine item has a quantity which decreases every time it is purchased. If too many are purchased then it will be sold out.
- Drinking bottled drinks leaves an empty bottle in the user's inventory which can be recycled for money.
- A user can import their own vending machine items from a .txt file to make the game customisable.
- If the user wins, their username and move count is saved in a leaderboard. This leaderboard can be saved to a .txt file.
- If an invalid input is entered, an error message is displayed to the user in the info section.
